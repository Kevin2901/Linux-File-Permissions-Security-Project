# 📌 Overview

This repository contains my Linux File Permissions Management portfolio project.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to manage and secure files in a Linux environment using permissions, ownership, and access control concepts. This exercise mirrors real responsibilities of cybersecurity and system administrators in protecting sensitive files and directories.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

This project demonstrates the ability to:

- View and interpret Linux file permissions

- Modify permissions using chmod, umask, symbolic and numeric notation

- Manage file and directory ownership using chown and chgrp

- Apply the principle of least privilege

- Identify and correct insecure permissions

- Create secure directory structures for different user groups

- Understand permission impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

# 🧩 Scenario Summary

In this project, I worked in a simulated Linux environment where I was responsible for securing files and directories containing sensitive organizational data. The tasks included:

- Analyzing current permissions and identifying misconfigurations

- Updating permissions to restrict unauthorized access

- Assigning user and group ownership appropriately

- Applying secure defaults using masks and role-based permission design

- Documenting permission changes and explaining their security impact

This simulation reflects common tasks performed by cybersecurity analysts and Linux system administrators.


# 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
Linux Tools & Commands

ls -l — view permissions

chmod — modify permissions (numeric & symbolic)

chown — change file and directory ownership

chgrp — update group ownership

umask — configure default permissions

mkdir, touch, cp, mv, rm — file management commands

- Security Concepts

Principle of Least Privilege

Access Control

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)

Secure file and directory structuring

User and group privilege modeling

# 📝 Tasks Completed

- Identified files with overly permissive settings (e.g., 777)

- Restricted sensitive directories to authorized users only

- Assigned proper ownership to department-specific files

- Implemented group-based access for collaborative folders

- Ensured system configuration files had secure permissions

- Applied umask settings to enforce secure default permissions
